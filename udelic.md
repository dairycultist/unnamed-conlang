## Morphology

### Inflectional

**Nouns** are inflected for number.

`-Ø singular`

`-é [i] plural` (note irregular spelling)

**Verbs** agree with the subject in person and number.

|            | Singular | Plural     |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1st person | `-g [k]` | `-gé [gi]` |
| 2nd person | `-m [m]` | `-mé [mi]` |
| 3rd person | `-k [k]` | `-ké [ki]` |

Note that the 1st and 3rd person singular are identical. Also note the irregular spelling of the plural forms.

### Derivational

## Phonology

Voiced obstruents are devoiced word-finally, when geminated, and when in the context of voiceless obstruents. Voiceless obstruents, in contrast, are never revoiced (even in the context of voiced segments).
