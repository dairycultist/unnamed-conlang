## Morphology

### Inflectional

**Nouns** are inflected for number.

`-Ø singular`

`-é [i] plural` (note irregular spelling)

**Verbs** agree with the subject in person and number.

|            | Singular | Plural     |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1st person | `-g /g/` | `-gé /gi/` |
| 2nd person | `-m /m/` | `-mé /mi/` |
| 3rd person | `-k /k/` | `-ké /ki/` |

Note that the 1st and 3rd person singular are pronounced identically after word-final devoicing. Also note the irregular spelling of the plural forms.

Uninflected verbs (lemma form) are nominal, ex. `gan agrug gonẞig 'I like learning'`

### Derivational

## Phonology

Gemination is a thing. There are six vowels.

An epenthetic schwa is inserted between illegal clusters (ex. `/gonsig/ + /g/ -> [gonsigək] 'I learn'`

Voiced obstruents are devoiced word-finally, when geminated, and when in the context of voiceless obstruents. Voiceless obstruents, in contrast, are never revoiced (even in the context of voiced segments).

## Orthography

The orthography is phonemic, not phonetic (writing reflects the form before sound changes).

`ẞß /s/`

`Ss /ʃ/`

`Ee /ə/`

`Éé /e/`

`Hh /x/`

## Lexicon

### Pronouns

|            | Singular    | Plural        |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1st person | `gan /gan/` | `gané /gani/` |
| 2nd person | `man /man/` | `mané /mani/` |
| 3rd person | `ke /kə/`   | `ki /ki/`     |

Note the irregular pluralization of the 3rd person plural.

There also exists a 1st person inclusive dual (i.e. between the speaker and listener), `gamman /gamːan/`.
