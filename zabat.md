### Phonology

Only voiced obstruents.

Word-final devoicing.

Progressive height harmony (only \[-open] undergo harmony, and \[a] is unspecified for \[close], thus \[a] is neutral/transparent). Harmony affects both under- and fully specified segments (i.e. delinking will occur in the case of the latter).
```
/a/   [+open]
/o,e/ [-open -close]
/u,i/ [-open +close]
```

/a, o, e/ are pronounced \[ə] in non-careful speech.

### Morphology

#### Nouns

Note that subjects and objects are inflected the same way. More animate nouns are ALWAYS assumed to be the subject and less animate the object (regardless of word order), UNLESS the verb is passivized (where expectations are inverted).

```
-Ø        / Transitive subject and object

-it ~ -et / Intransitive agent-like argument

-arl      / Intransitive patient-like argument, Dative, Adpositional
