### Phonology

Only voiced obstruents. Word-final devoicing.

progressive height harmony (only \[-open] undergo harmony, thus \[a] is neutral)
```
[a] [+open]
[o,e] [-open -close]
[u,i] [-open +close]
```

\[zuga gort zan ʒibap]

### Morphology

Note that subjects and objects are inflected the same way. More animate nouns are ALWAYS assumed to be the subject and less animate the object (regardless of word order), UNLESS the verb is passivized (where expectations are inverted).

narp-Ø / Transitive subject and object

narb-it / Intransitive agent-like argument

narb-arl / Intransitive patient-like argument, Dative, Adpositional

mog- / Verb passiziation
