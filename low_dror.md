dror which is spoken by mechanical semi-organic constructs

- they no eep
- they don't have noses, lips, or teeth, do have tongues tho
- they are very large, so their airways are very long, making it easy to articulate sounds at any places
- their tongue can't move very fast so clusters must be homorganic
- their jaw can't move very fast so medial vowels tend to be lowered to be closer to consonant articulation
- they can replicate voicing
