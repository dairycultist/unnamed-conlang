Dror (_endonym:_ \[dʒʌʒ]) is spoken by mechanical semi-organic constructs. Low Dror is a dialect spoken by labourers in the Low Valley. It is oral/unwritten.

Physiology
- They don't sleep
- They don't have noses (no nasal consonants/vowels), lips (no labial consonants or rounded vowels), or teeth (no dental consonants); they do have tongues though
- They are very large, so their airways are very long, making it easy to articulate sounds at many places
- Their tongue can't move very fast so clusters must be homorganic
- Their jaw can't move very fast so medial vowels tend to be raised to be closer to consonant articulation
- They can replicate voicing
