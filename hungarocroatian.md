# Hungaro-Croatian creole

Source language analysis is pretty inaccurate but idk this is for fun and not terribly realistic

# Source languages

I ate the green apples in the school.

```
Megettem a zöldalmákat az iskolában.

# Pidginization

| Lex.    | Hungarian        | Croatian     | Pidgin       |
|---------|------------------|--------------|--------------|

- articles (from Hungarian) are lost
- gender inflection (from Croatian) is lost
- Case is simplified
- Maintains regressive voicing assimilation ([from both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_phonology#Assimilation_of_voice))
- Hungarian `meg` is reinterpreted as a past particle
- Phonology is highly variable between speakers

# Creolization
(fully systematic, removes irregularities)

- Standardized phonology
  - Length is lost (I couldn't find a good source for the length of Croatian lexical items)
  - Five vowel system
    - Hungarian vowel harmony is (obviously) lost
  - Hungarian /c ɟ/ merge with /t͡ɕ d͡ʑ/
  - Croatian /ʎ/ merges with /j/
  - Croatian retroflex consonants become postalveolar (a common alternation even in the [source language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_phonology#Consonants)), except in cases where [they alternate with velars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_phonology#Palatalization), where they become the velar consonant instead.
